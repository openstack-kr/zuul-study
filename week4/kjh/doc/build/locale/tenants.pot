msgid "Most actions in zuul-web, zuul-client, and the REST API are understood to be within the context of a specific tenant and therefore the authorization rules specified by that tenant apply.  When zuul-web is deployed in a multi-tenant scenario (the default), there are a few extra actions or API methods which are outside of the context of an individual tenant (for example, listing the tenants or observing the state of Zuul system components).  To control access to these methods, an `api-root` object can be used."

This is intended so that an operator can issue an overriding access token manually. If this is an issue, it is advised to add finer filtering to admin rules, for example, filtering by the ``iss`` claim (generally equal to the issuer ID)."
