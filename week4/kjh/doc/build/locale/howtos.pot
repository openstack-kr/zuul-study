This guide will walk you through setting up an account on the matrix.org homeserver."

Since it's *end-to-end* encryption, that means your encryption keys are stored on your client, and the server has no way to decrypt those messages.  But that also means that if you sign out of your client or switch browsers, you will lose your encryption keys along with access to any old messages that were encrypted with them.  To avoid this, you can back up your keys to the server (in an encrypted form, of course) so that if you log in from another session, you can restore those keys and pick up where you left off.
