msgid "Nodepool"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:12
msgid "In order to run all but the simplest jobs, Zuul uses a companion program `Nodepool <https://opendev.org/zuul/nodepool>`__ to supply the nodes (whether dynamic cloud instances or static hardware) used by jobs.  Before starting Zuul, ensure you have Nodepool installed and any images you require built."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:18
msgid "Zuul must be able to log into the nodes provisioned by Nodepool with a given username and SSH private key.  Executors should also be able to talk to nodes on TCP port 19885 for log streaming; see :ref:`nodepool_console_streaming`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:24
msgid "ZooKeeper"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:28
msgid "Zuul and Nodepool use ZooKeeper to communicate internally among their components, and also to communicate with each other.  You can run a simple single-node ZooKeeper instance, or a multi-node cluster. Ensure that all Zuul and Nodepool hosts have access to the cluster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:33
msgid "Zuul stores all possible state within ZooKeeper so that it can be effectively shared and coordinated between instances of its component services. Most of this is ephemeral and can be recreated or is of low value if lost, but a clustered deployment will provide improved continuity and resilience in the event of an incident adversely impacting a ZooKeeper server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:40
msgid "Zuul's keystore (project-specific keys for asymmetric encryption of job secrets and SSH access) is also stored in ZooKeeper, and unlike the other data it **cannot be recreated** if lost. As such, periodic :ref:`export and backup <backup>` of these keys is strongly recommended."
msgstr ""

msgid "Executor Deployment"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:51
msgid "The Zuul executor requires Ansible to run jobs.  There are two approaches that can be used to install Ansible for Zuul."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:54
msgid "First you may set ``manage_ansible`` to True in the executor config. If you do this Zuul will install all supported Ansible versions on zuul-executor startup. These installations end up in Zuul's state dir, ``/var/lib/zuul/ansible-bin`` if unchanged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:59
msgid "The second option is to use ``zuul-manage-ansible`` to install the supported Ansible versions. By default this will install Ansible to ``zuul_install_prefix/lib/zuul/ansible``. This method is preferable to the first because it speeds up zuul-executor start time and allows you to preinstall ansible in containers (avoids problems with bind mounted zuul state dirs)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:68
msgid "In both cases if using a non default path you will want to set ``ansible_root`` in the executor config file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Web Deployment"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:76
msgid "The ``zuul-web`` service provides a web dashboard, a REST API and a websocket log streaming service as a single holistic web application. For production use it is recommended to run it behind a reverse proxy, such as Apache or Nginx."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:80
msgid "The ``zuul-web`` service is entirely self-contained and can be run with minimal configuration, however, more advanced users may desire to do one or more of the following:"

msgid "White Label"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:85
msgid "Serve the dashboard of an individual tenant at the root of its own domain. https://zuul.openstack.org is an example of a Zuul dashboard that has been white labeled for the ``openstack`` tenant of its Zuul."

#: ../../source/installation.rst:98
msgid "Serve a Zuul dashboard from a location below the root URL as part of presenting integration with other application. https://softwarefactory-project.io/zuul/ is an example of a Zuul dashboard that is being served from a Sub-URL."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:103
msgid "Most deployments shouldn't need these, so the following discussion will assume that the ``zuul-web`` service is exposed via a reverse proxy. Where rewrite rule examples are given, they will be given with Apache syntax, but any other reverse proxy should work just fine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:109
msgid "Reverse Proxy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:111
msgid "Using Apache as the reverse proxy requires the ``mod_proxy``, ``mod_proxy_http`` and ``mod_proxy_wstunnel`` modules to be installed and enabled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:115
msgid "All of the cases require a rewrite rule for the websocket streaming, so the simplest reverse-proxy case is::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:122
msgid "This is the recommended configuration unless one of the following features is required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/installation.rst:128
msgid "To have the reverse proxy serve the static html/javascript assets instead of proxying them to the REST layer, enable the ``mod_rewrite`` Apache module, register the location where you unpacked the web application as the document root and add rewrite rules::"

msgid "The web dashboard source code and package.json are located in the ``web`` directory. All the yarn commands need to be executed from the ``web`` directory."

#: ../../source/installation.rst:198
msgid "Running a white-labeled tenant is similar to the offload case, but adds a rule to ensure connection webhooks don't try to get put into the tenant scope."

msgid "It's possible to do white-labeling without static offload, but it is more complex with no benefit."
