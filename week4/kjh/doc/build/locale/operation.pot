msgid "You can run any zuul process with the **-f** option to make it not daemonize and stay in the foreground, logging to your terminal. It's a good idea at first to check for issues with your configuration. There's also a **-d** option to engage verbose debug logging, but be careful in busy deployments as this can generate very large logs."

msgid "Reconfiguration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:41
msgid "Most of Zuul's configuration is automatically updated as changes to the repositories which contain it are merged.  However, Zuul must be explicitly notified of changes to the tenant config file, since it is not read from a git repository. Zuul supports two kinds of reconfigurations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:46
msgid "The full reconfiguration refetches and reloads the configuration of all tenants. To do so, run ``zuul-scheduler full-reconfigure``. For example this can be used to fix eventual configuration inconsistencies after connection problems with the code hosting system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:51
msgid "To perform the same actions as a full reconfiguration but for a single tenant, use ``zuul-scheduler tenant-reconfigure TENANT`` (where ``TENANT`` is the name of the tenant to reconfigure)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:55
msgid "The smart reconfiguration reloads only the tenants that changed their configuration in the tenant config file. To do so, run ``zuul-scheduler smart-reconfigure``. In multi tenant systems this can be much faster than the full reconfiguration so it is recommended to use the smart reconfiguration after changing the tenant configuration file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:62
msgid "The ``tenant-reconfigure`` and ``smart-reconfigure`` commands should only be run on a single scheduler.  Other schedulers will see any changes to the configuration stored in ZooKeeper and automatically update their configuration in the background without interrupting processing."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:74
msgid "The ``--wait-for-init`` option (or ``ZUUL_WAIT_FOR_INIT`` environment variable) will cause the scheduler to wait until all tenants have been initialized before it begins processing pipelines.  This may help large systems with excess scheduler capacity perform a rolling restart of schedulers more quickly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:80
msgid "The ``--disable-pipelines`` option (or ``ZUUL_DISABLE_PIPELINES`` environment variable) will cause the scheduler to silently discard all pipeline related events.  This allows the scheduler to create and maintain all of the configuration of a running system without running any jobs or making any reports."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:86
msgid "This option is not intended for normal use, and is only useful for certain testing and backup-related activities.  Because any scheduler connected to ZooKeeper can process events, it does not make sense to mix values of this option.  Normal production Zuul systems that are intended to process events should not set this option on any schedulers.  To use this option on a standby or testing cluster, set it on all schedulers."

msgid "There are two ways to manage queue processing for a tenant.  The first is using the web interface: authenticate as a tenant administrator, and a \"Manage Queues\" button will appear at the top of the status page; click that and fill out the form.  The second is using the ``zuul-client tenant-state`` command."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:127
msgid "While all of Zuul's component services are designed to be run in a resilient active-active clustered deployment, a good disaster recovery plan should include backing up critical data. At a minimum, the randomly-generated project keys used for encryption of job secrets and SSH access should be backed up, as they **cannot be recreated** if lost. Zuul stores these keys in a keystore in ZooKeeper which is inconvenient to back up directly, but provides an administrative tool to :ref:`export <export-keys>` these keys to and :ref:`import <import-keys>` them from a local directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:137
msgid "It's highly recommended to set up periodic automation for dumping such an export to a secure location (for example, on the filesystem of each Zuul Scheduler) for use in a disaster where all ZooKeeper content is lost. You may also consider configuring a safe remote backup of these files with the tool of your choice, but be aware that they are potentially sensitive since anyone who gains access to them could decrypt job secrets or access protected systems which have been instructed to trust those keys."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:146
msgid "Note that the exported keys are symmetrically encrypted with the same :ref:`keystore.password <keystore-password>` which is used for encrypting and decrypting the copy of them in ZooKeeper, because its the encrypted versions of the keys which are exported and imported. Someone with access to the keys would also need a copy of the keystore.password from Zuul's configuration, so for security-sensitive environments you may not want to back them up together. Conversely, if you lose the keystore.password then you also lose the use of the project keys in the keystore and any exports, so you will likely want to make sure you keep a secured copy of it somewhere as well in the event your server configuration is lost."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:170
msgid "To stop the merger, run ``zuul-merger stop``. This will wait for any currently running merge task to complete before exiting. As a result this is always a graceful way to stop the merger. ``zuul-merger graceful`` is an alias for ``zuul-merger stop`` to make this consistent with the executor."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:197

msgid "Ansible and Python 3"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:210
msgid "As noted above, the executor runs Ansible playbooks against the remote node(s) allocated for the job.  Since part of executing playbooks on remote hosts is running Python scripts on them, Ansible needs to know what Python interpreter to use on the remote host.  With older distributions, ``/usr/bin/python2`` was a generally sensible choice. However, over time a heterogeneous Python ecosystem has evolved where older distributions may only provide Python 2, most provide a mixed 2/3 environment and newer distributions may only provide Python 3 (and then others like RHEL8 may even have separate \"system\" Python versions to add to confusion!)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:221
msgid "Ansible's ``ansible_python_interpreter`` variable configures the path to the remote Python interpreter to use during playbook execution. This value is set by Zuul from the ``python-path`` specified for the node by Nodepool; see the `nodepool configuration documentation <https://zuul-ci.org/docs/nodepool/configuration.html>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:227
msgid "This defaults to ``auto``, where Ansible will automatically discover the interpreter available on the remote host.  However, this setting only became available in Ansible >=2.8, so Zuul will translate ``auto`` into the old default of ``/usr/bin/python2`` when configured to use older Ansible versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:233
msgid "Thus for modern Python 3-only hosts no further configuration is needed when using Ansible >=2.8 (e.g. Fedora, Bionic onwards).  If using earlier Ansible versions you may need to explicitly set the ``python-path`` if ``/usr/bin/python2`` is not available on the node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/operation.rst:238
msgid "Ansible roles/modules which include Python code are generally Python 3 safe now, but there is still a small possibility of incompatibility. See also the Ansible `Python 3 support page <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/python_3_support.html>`__."

msgstr ""

msgid "For Kubernetes-based job nodes the connection from the executor to the log streaming daemon is established by using ``kubectl port-forward`` to forward a local port to the appropriate port on the pod containing the job node.
