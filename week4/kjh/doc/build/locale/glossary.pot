Every build is assigned a globally unique identifier which is used when coordinating between Zuul's component services, and for purposes such as addressing log streams and results in the status API and Web dashboard.

It usually has an :value:`independent <pipeline.manager.independent>` pipeline manager since the final sequence of changes to merge is not generally known at the time of upload."

By triggering on a branch update (rather than a merge) event, jobs in this pipeline may run with the final git state after the merge (including any merge commits generated by the upstream code review system).  This is important when building some artifacts in order that the exact commit ids are present in the git repo.  The downside to this approach is that jobs in this pipeline run without any connection to the underlying changes which created the commits.  If only the latest updates to a branch matter, then the :value:`supercedent <pipeline.manager.supercedent>` pipeline manager is recommended; otherwise :value:`independent <pipeline.manager.independent>` may be a better choice.

When all of the jobs in the gate pipeline succeed, the change will be merged and may then be enqueued into a promote pipeline. Jobs running in this pipeline do so with the understanding that since the change merged as it was tested in the gate, any artifacts created at that time are now safe to promote to production. It is a good choice to use a :value:`supercedent <pipeline.manager.supercedent>` pipeline manager so that if many changes merge in rapid sequence, Zuul may skip promoting all but the latest artifact to production."

msgid "A term borrowed from microprocessor design, the idea that sequenced operations can be performed in parallel by predicting their possible outcomes and then discarding any logical branches which turn out not to be true.  Zuul uses optimistic prediction to assume all builds for a change will succeed, and then proceeds to run parallel builds for other changes which would follow it in sequence.
