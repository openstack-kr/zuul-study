Because it has access to normally restricted features in Zuul, changes to this repository are not dynamically evaluated by Zuul.

Projects are able to attach jobs to run in that pipeline, and when they complete, the results are reported along with actions which may trigger further Pipelines.  In a gating system two pipelines are required: :term:`check` and :term:`gate`.  In our system, ``check`` will be triggered when a patch is uploaded to Gerrit, so that we are able to immediately run tests and report whether the change works and is therefore able to merge.  The ``gate`` pipeline is triggered when a code reviewer approves the change in Gerrit.  It will run test jobs again (in case other changes have merged since the change in question was uploaded) and if these final tests pass, will automatically merge the change.
