"This command is provided to manually simulate a trigger from an external "

"gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/projects/plugins/hooks>`__ such as "
"``patchset-created`` and ``ref-updated`` is recommended.  Some examples of "

"It is common to have a ``release`` pipeline that listens for new tags coming "

"triggering of the jobs.  To re-trigger the jobs, pass the failed tag as the "

"Another common pipeline is a ``post`` queue listening for ``gerrit`` merge "

"heads/master`` for the project from ``oldrev`` to ``newrev``\" (``newrev`` "
