"Maintainers.  In general, approval is sought from at least two maintainers "
"before merging a change, but fewer or more reviews may be warranted "
"depending on the change.  Factors to consider when reviewing are the "
"complexity of the change, whether it is in accordance with the project "
"design, and whether additional project participants with subject matter "
"expertise should review the change. Maintainers may also reject changes "
"outright, but this is expected to be used sparingly in favor of (or in the "

"regressive behavior or make the project more difficult to support in the "
"future.  Secondly, and just as important, the process also ensures that "
