msgid ""
"When a system administrator configures Zuul to operate on a project, they "
"specify one of two security contexts for that project.  A *config-project* "
"is one which is primarily tasked with holding configuration information and "
"job content for Zuul.  Jobs which are defined in a config-project are run "
"with elevated privileges, and all Zuul configuration items are available for "
"use.  Base jobs (that is, jobs without a parent) may only be defined in "
"config-projects.  It is expected that changes to config-projects will "
"undergo careful scrutiny before being merged."

"An *untrusted-project* is a project whose primary focus is not to operate "
"Zuul, but rather it is one of the projects being tested or deployed.  The "
"Zuul configuration language available to these projects is somewhat "
"restricted (as detailed in individual sections below), and jobs defined in "
"these projects run in a restricted execution environment since they may be "
"operating on changes which have not yet undergone review."

"When Zuul starts, it examines all of the git repositories which are "
"specified by the system administrator in :ref:`tenant-config` and searches "

"``zuul.yaml`` or a directory named ``zuul.d``, and if they are not found, ``."
"zuul.yaml`` or ``.zuul.d`` (with a leading dot). In the case of an :term:"
"`untrusted-project`, the configuration from every branch is included, "
"however, in the case of a :term:`config-project`, only a single branch is "
"examined. The config project branch can be configured with the tenant "

"When a change is proposed to one of these files in an untrusted-project, the "
"configuration proposed in the change is merged into the running "
"configuration so that any changes to Zuul's configuration are self-testing "
"as part of that change.  If there is a configuration error, no jobs will be "
"run and the error will be reported by any applicable pipelines.  In the case "
"of a change to a config-project, the new configuration is parsed and "
"examined for errors, but the new configuration is not used in testing the "
"change. This is because configuration in config-projects is able to access "
"elevated privileges and should always be reviewed before being merged."

"Zuul currently supports one encryption scheme, PKCS#1 with OAEP, which can "

"4096 bits minus 336 bits of overhead).  The padding used by this scheme "
"ensures that someone examining the encrypted data can not determine the "

"In the config files themselves, Zuul uses an extensible method of specifying "
