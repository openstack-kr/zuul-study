"Zuul is a Project Gating System.  That's like a CI or CD system, but the "
"focus is on testing the future state of code repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about.rst:11
msgid ""
"A gating system doesn't just test a proposed change; it tests the proposed "
"future state of multiple branches and repositories with any number of in-"
"flight changes and their dependencies.  And the same playbooks used to test "
"software can also be used to deploy it."

"Zuul itself is a service which listens to events from various code review "
"systems, executes jobs based on those events, and reports the results back "
"to the code review system.  The primary interface for Zuul is the code "
"review system (or systems) so that it fits seamlessly into developer "
"workflows, and a web interface is available for inspecting the current "
"status and browsing build results."

"The best way to run Zuul is with a single installation serving as many "
"projects or groups as possible.  It is a multi-tenant application that is "
"able to provide as much or as little separation between projects as desired."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about.rst:28
msgid ""
"Zuul works with a wide range of code review systems, and can work with "
"multiple systems (including integrating projects on different systems) "
"simultaneously.  See :ref:`drivers` for a complete list."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about.rst:32
msgid ""
"Previous versions of Zuul required a separate component called `Nodepool`_ "
"to provide the resources to run jobs.  Nodepool works with several cloud "
"providers as well as statically defined nodes (again, simultaneously).  "
"Nodepool's functionality is now incorporated into Zuul."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about.rst:38
msgid ""
"Because Zuul is designed from the ground up to run jobs in a multi-node "
"environment (whether those nodes are bare metal machines, VMs, Kubernetes "
"clusters, or containers), Zuul's job definition language needs to support "
"orchestrating tasks on multiple nodes.  Zuul uses Ansible for this.  Ansible "
"is well-known and easy to learn and use.  Some existing Ansible playbooks "
"and roles may be able to be used directly with Zuul (but some restrictions "
"apply, so not all will)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about.rst:46
msgid ""
"However, knowledge or use of Ansible is not required for Zuul -- it is quite "
"simple for Zuul's embedded Ansible to run any shell script or any other "
"program.  Zuul's library of standard jobs even includes a job that will run "
"a specified shell script, so it's possible to use Zuul without writing any "
"Ansible at all."
