"Zuul jobs are implemented as Ansible playbooks.  Zuul prepares the "
"repositories used for a job, installs any required Ansible roles, and then "
"executes the job's playbooks.  Any setup or artifact collection required is "
"the responsibility of the job itself.  While this flexible arrangement "
"allows for almost any kind of job to be run by Zuul, batteries are "
"included.  Zuul has a standard library of jobs upon which to build."
