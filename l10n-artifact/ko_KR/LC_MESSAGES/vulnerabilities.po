"Zuul strives to be as secure as possible, implementing a layered defense-in-"
"depth approach where any untrusted code is executed and leveraging well-"
"reviewed popular libraries for its cryptographic needs. Still, bugs are "
"inevitable and security bugs are no exception to that rule."

"If you've found a bug in Zuul and you suspect it may compromise the security "
"of some part of the system, we'd appreciate the opportunity to privately "
"discuss the details before any suspected vulnerability is made public. There "
"are a couple possible ways you can bring security bugs to our attention:"

"Enter a short but memorable title for your vulnerability report and provide "
"risks, concerns or other relevant details in the description field. Where it "
"lists teams and users that can see this story, add the ``zuul-security`` "
"team so they'll be able to work on triaging it. For the initial task, select "
"the project to which this is specific (e.g., ``zuul/zuul`` or ``zuul/"
"nodepool``) and if it relates to additional projects you can add another "
"task for each of them making sure to include a relevant title for each task. "
"When you've included all the detail and tasks you want, save the new story "
"and then you can continue commenting on it normally. Please don't remove the "
"``Private`` setting, and instead wait for one of the zuul-security reviewers "
"to do this once it's deemed safe."
