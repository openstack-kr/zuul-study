"Zuul is a distributed system consisting of several components, each of which "
"is described below."

"Each of the Zuul processes may run on the same host, or different hosts."

"Previous versions of Zuul used Nodepool to provide build nodes; new "
"installations should use Zuul's internal resource management and not "
"Nodepool."

#: ../../source/components.rst:61
msgid ""
"Zuul requires an external ZooKeeper cluster running at least ZooKeeper "
"version 3.5.1, and all Zuul and Nodepool components need to be able to "
"connect to the hosts in that cluster on a TLS-encrypted TCP port, typically "
"2281."

#: ../../source/components.rst:66
msgid ""
"Both the Nodepool (or Zuul) launchers and Zuul executors need to be able to "
"communicate with the hosts which Nodepool (or Zuul) provides. If these are "
"on private networks, the executors will need to be able to route traffic to "
"them."

msgid ""
"Only Zuul fingergw and Zuul web need to be publicly accessible; executors "
"never do. Executors should be accessible on TCP port 7900 by fingergw and "
"web."

"A database is required and configured in ``database`` section of ``/etc/zuul/"

"If statsd is enabled, the executors and schedulers need to be able to emit "
"data to statsd.  Statsd can be configured to run on each host and forward "
"data, or services may emit to a centralized statsd collector. Statsd listens "
"on UDP port 8125 by default."

"A minimal Zuul system may consist of a :ref:`scheduler` and :ref:`executor` "
"both running on the same host.  Larger installations should consider running "
"multiple schedulers, executors and mergers, with each component running on a "
"dedicated host."
