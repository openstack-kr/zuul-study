"Access to Zuul's REST API and web interface can optionally be restricted.  "
"By default, anonymous read access to any tenant is permitted.  Optionally, "
"some administrative actions may also be enabled and restricted to authorized "
"users.  Additionally, individual tenants or the entire system may have read-"
"level access restricted to authorized users."

"The supported administrative actions are **autohold**, **enqueue/enqueue-"

"Anybody with a valid administrative token can perform privileged actions "

"manually issued, is not trivial."

"As a mitigation, tokens should be generated with a short time to live, like "
"10 minutes or less. If the token contains authorization Information (see the "
"``zuul.admin`` claim below), it should be generated with as little a scope "
"as possible (one tenant only) to reduce the surface of attack should the "
"token be compromised."

"Exposing administration tasks can impact build results (dequeue-ing "
"buildsets), and pose potential resources problems if the ``autohold`` "
"feature is abused, leading to a significant number of nodes remaining in "
"\"hold\" state for extended periods of time. As always, \"with great power "
"comes great responsibility\" and tokens should be handed over with "

"With such an authenticator, a Zuul operator can use Zuul's CLI to issue "
